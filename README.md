# UK Tech Huddle

Welcome to the UK Tech Huddle site. The purpose of this site is to help people get hands-on with technology related to Microsoft Azure. It spans Infrastructure, Data, IoT and Application Innovation.

Each of the topics below follows the same flow:

1. Topic Overview (10 mins) - Outlines the problem trying to be solved.

1. Hands-on (30 - 40 mins) - This is where we get hands-on through learning to do a demo.

1. Roadmap + Q & A (10 - 15 mins) - This is where we highlight and discuss key Azure roadmap items that have recently previewed or GA'd that have helped solve customer problems.
